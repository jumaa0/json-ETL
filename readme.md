# **NYC Philharmonic ETL Pipeline**  
##### Developed as part of a Bosta-casestudy project.

---
## **Overview**  
This project processes a large JSON dataset from the NYC Philharmonic archive, extracts meaningful information, and transforms it into structured text files. The processed data is then inserted into a MySQL database. The entire process is managed by a monitoring script that ensures reliability and retries if needed.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Extract & Transform:**  
   - `ETL.py` reads `raw_nyc_phil.json`, extracts key information, and saves it into multiple text files in `./trg`.  
   - The extracted tables include orchestras, programs, concerts, works, and soloists.  

2. **Monitoring & Execution:**  
   - The `monitor_job.sh` script runs `ETL.py`, checks if all output files are created, and retries up to 3 times if necessary.  
   - If all files are successfully created, `insert_to_db.py` inserts the data into a MySQL database (optional).  
   - After successful execution, `./trg` is deleted if MySQL is set up.  

---

## **How to Run**  

### **Step 1: Run the Monitoring Script**  

Simply execute:  

```bash
bash monitor_job.sh
```

This script will:  
âœ… Run the ETL process.  
âœ… Retry on failure (up to 3 times).  
âœ… Insert data into MySQL (if installed).  
âœ… Clean up the `./trg` directory after successful execution.  

### **Step 2: Verify the Output**  

Check the extracted data in the `./trg` directory before it is deleted:  

```bash
ls -l ./trg
```

Each `.txt` file contains structured data extracted from the JSON file.  

---

## **Database Integration (Optional)**  

If MySQL is installed, `insert_to_db.py` will insert the extracted data into a database. Ensure:  
- MySQL is running.  
- A database is created.  
- Database credentials are configured in `insert_to_db.py`.  

After execution, the `./trg` directory will be deleted.  

---

## **Customization**  

- To modify the JSON processing logic, update `ETL.py`.  
- To change database configurations, edit `insert_to_db.py`.  
- To adjust retry logic, modify `monitor_job.sh`.

## **Troubleshooting**  

| **Issue**                | **Solution**                              |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Missing output files     | Ensure `ETL.py` runs properly            |  
| Script fails after retries | Check error messages in `monitor_job.sh` |  
| MySQL insertion issues  | Verify database connection & schema       |
